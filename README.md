# My first web scraper

_31 March 2020_

During class, we built a web scraper to scrape Premier League stats off of BBC Sports.

### Dependencies:

- Axios: Node library that allows us to fetch the html from the website URL
- Cheerio: Node library that lets us navigate the DOM with Node and use selectors to pull elements/text out

### How to run:

- In console, run: **node pl-scraper.js**
